# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Heart disease is the leading cause of death and a major cause of disability in the United States. About 600,000 Americans die of heart disease annually. This represents almost 25% of all U.S. deaths. To raise awareness of this disease, February has been recognized as “American Heart Month” since 1963.

Some conditions, such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes, as well as lifestyle factors, such as unhealthy diet, obesity, physical inactivity, and alcohol and tobacco use, can put people at a higher risk for developing heart disease. A tendency toward heart disease can cluster in families; thus, family medical history offers important information for identifying risk in individuals. Such histories can capture the effects and interactions of shared genetic and environmental factors that lead to disease in a family.

## The Heart Disease prediction will have the following steps:

- Data insight: Here we will be working with the heart disease detection dataset and we will be putting out interesting inferences from the data to derive some meaningful results.
- EDA: Exploratory data analysis is the key step for getting meaningful results.
- Feature engineering: After getting the insights from the data we have to alter the features so that they can move forward for the model building phase.
- Model building: In this phase, we will be building our Machine learning model for heart disease detection.
